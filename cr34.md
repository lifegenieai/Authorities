## (b) Procedure
<!-- anchor: cr34-b -->

1. **Service.** The request may, without leave of court, be served upon the plaintiff after the summons and a copy of the complaint are served upon the defendant, or the complaint is filed, whichever shall first occur, and upon any other party with or after service of the summons and complaint upon that party.

2. **Contents of the Request.** The request:
   - (A) shall set forth the items to be produced either by individual item or by category, and describe each item and category with reasonable particularity;
   - (B) shall specify a reasonable time, place, and manner of making the production and performing the related acts;
   - (C) may specify the form or forms in which electronically stored information is to be produced.

3. **Responses and Objections.**
   - (A) **Time to Respond.** The responding party shall serve a written response within 30 days after the service of the request, except that a defendant may serve a response within 40 days after service of the summons and complaint upon that defendant. The parties may stipulate or the court may allow a shorter or longer time.
   - (B) **Responding to Each Item.** For each item or category, the response must either state that inspection and related activities will be permitted as requested or state a specific objection to the request, including the reasons.
   - (C) **Objections.** An objection to part of a request must specify the part and permit inspection of the rest.
   - (D) **Responding to a Request for Electronically Stored Information.** The response may state an objection to a requested form for producing electronically stored information. If the responding party objects to a form or forms or if no form was specified in the request—the responding party must state the form or forms it intends to use.
   - (E) **Failure to Make Discovery.** For any failure to make discovery under this rule, the requesting party may move for an order as provided under rule 37.
   - (F) **Producing the Documents or Electronically Stored Information.** Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court:
      1. A party who produces things, electronically stored information, or documents for inspection shall produce them as they are kept in the usual course of business or shall organize and label them to correspond with the categories in the request;
      2. If a request does not specify a form for producing electronically stored information, a party must produce it in a form or forms in which it is ordinarily maintained or in a reasonably usable form or forms; and
      3. Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, for good cause shown, a party need not produce the same electronically stored information in more than one form.

## Introduction

When you receive the opposing party’s discovery responses, your immediate task is to **verify what was provided, organize the materials, and scrutinize the completeness and accuracy of each response**. In Washington family law, discovery is governed by Civil Rules (CR) 26-37. This guide gives best-practice, actionable steps for processing incoming discovery—auditing answers, identifying deficiencies, and preparing for a CR 26(i) conference (meet-and-confer)—all *before* motion practice. The aim is to ensure no discovery issue falls through the cracks and to set you up for a successful resolution of discovery disputes.

## Step 1: Verify Receipt and Completeness of Responses
<!-- anchor: step1-verify -->

### **Action Checklist**
- [ ] Confirm timely delivery (due date met?)
- [ ] Inventory: Response for each ROG, RFP, RFA served?
- [ ] Confirm document delivery method (can you open all files? Are all referenced attachments present?)
- [ ] Check for proper format: Each request addressed? Numbering matches?
- [ ] Signatures and oaths: Are interrogatories signed and under oath? Are RFP and RFA responses signed?
- [ ] Preserve originals (envelope, email, cover letter, postmark)
- [ ] Log date of service/receipt and any noted delay

> **Tip:** Start a tracking spreadsheet with each discovery set, date served, and date received.

## Step 2: Organize and Index the Discovery Materials
<!-- anchor: step2-organize -->

### **Action Checklist**
- [ ] Set up folders: “Interrogatory Answers,” “RFP Responses,” “RFA Responses,” “Produced Documents – Opposing Party”
- [ ] Apply Bates numbering if not already present; send copy to opposing party for confirmation
- [ ] Create index/table mapping each response to the corresponding request (ROG1 = ...; RFP1 = ...; etc.)
- [ ] Attempt to group/sort documents by request (as labeled, or by best inference)
- [ ] Maintain evidence log: List each document/category produced and what request it matches
- [ ] Calendar: Discovery deadlines, follow-up dates, discovery cutoff

---

## Step 3: Audit the Interrogatory Answers (“ROGs”)
<!-- anchor: step3-rogs -->

### **Action Checklist**
- [ ] Each answer under oath, signed by the responding party?
- [ ] Is each interrogatory separately answered (no lumping)?
- [ ] Does each answer fully and directly respond to the question?
- [ ] Are any answers evasive, vague, or deferred (“information will be provided later”)?
- [ ] Are “see documents” answers specific enough (Bates numbers or exact document reference)?
- [ ] Objections: Are they stated with reasons, and do they provide an answer “subject to objection”?
- [ ] Are all subparts answered?
- [ ] Did they promise future supplementation (note for follow-up)?

### **Audit Table Example:**

| ROG # | Issue/Deficiency               | Rule         | Priority | Resolution Needed    |
|-------|-------------------------------|--------------|----------|---------------------|
| 2     | No verification signed        | CR 33(a)     | High     | Request verification|
| 5     | Incomplete, says “don’t recall” | CR 33(a)   | High     | Press for details   |
| 7     | Objected, no answer           | CR 33(a)     | High     | Demand answer/clarify|

---

## Step 4: Audit the Requests for Production (RFPs)
<!-- anchor: step4-rfps -->

### **Action Checklist**
- [ ] Written response for each RFP, by number?
- [ ] What was produced for each? (Log in your index)
- [ ] Are objections stated with reasons? If partial production, did they unilaterally narrow your request?
- [ ] Any claims of privilege? Was a privilege log provided?
- [ ] Does production appear complete (no obvious gaps)?
- [ ] Was the document production organized/labeled to correspond to requests, or is it a “document dump”?
- [ ] Are all copies legible?
- [ ] For each RFP, note: “Fully satisfied,” “Partially satisfied,” or “Not satisfied”

### **Audit Table Example:**

| RFP # | Outcome           | Deficiency/Issue                    | Resolution Needed         |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 3     | Partially satisfied | 2020 tax return missing           | Request missing year     |
| 5     | Not satisfied     | Objected “burdensome,” no docs      | Propose narrower scope   |
| 10    | Partially         | Produced docs not labeled by request | Ask for clarification    |

## Step 5: Audit the Requests for Admission (RFAs)
<!-- anchor: step5-rfas -->

### **Action Checklist**
- [ ] Were responses timely? If not, note any “deemed admitted” RFAs
- [ ] Each RFA: Admitted, Denied, or “Unable to admit/deny”?
- [ ] Are denials qualified/proper (address the substance)?
- [ ] “Lack info”: Did they state reasonable inquiry was made?
- [ ] Objections: Are they valid? (Remember: can’t object just because fact is disputed)
- [ ] Any non-responsive or evasive answers?
- [ ] Tally and record all as Admitted, Denied, or Deficient

### **Audit Table Example:**

| RFA # | Status    | Deficiency/Issue                  | Resolution Needed         |
|-------|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 4     | Deficient | “Lacks info,” no inquiry stated   | Demand proper answer     |
| 7     | Deficient | Objected “legal conclusion”       | Require admit/deny       |
| 9     | No answer | Deemed admitted                   | Confirm, or allow fix    |

## Step 6: Document the Deficiencies – Discovery Audit Checklist
<!-- anchor: step6-deficiency -->

### **Action Checklist**
- [ ] List all deficiencies by type (ROG, RFP, RFA), number, and issue
- [ ] Cite the rule violated (CR 33, CR 34, CR 36, etc.)
- [ ] Note priority (High/Med/Low)
- [ ] Leave a column for “Response/Resolution”
- [ ] Attach or reference supporting evidence if helpful (e.g., proof a denial is false)
- [ ] Keep tone factual, not accusatory

**Sample Table:**

| Type    | Number | Issue/Deficiency                             | Rule        | Priority | Opposing Party’s Response/Resolution |
|---------|--------|----------------------------------------------|-------------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| ROG     | 2      | No verification                             | CR 33(a)    | High     |                                      |
| RFP     | 3      | Missing Nov-Dec statements                  | CR 34       | High     |                                      |
| RFA     | 4      | “Lacks info,” no inquiry                    | CR 36(a)    | High     |                                      |
| RFP     | 10     | Produced docs not labeled by request         | CR 34(f)(i) | Medium   |                                      |

## Step 7: Meet-and-Confer Preparation (CR 26(i) Conference)
<!-- anchor: step7-meet-confer -->

### **Action Checklist**
- [ ] Contact opposing counsel/party promptly; label as “CR 26(i) Conference”
- [ ] Draft and send a deficiency letter/email with a list of issues and requests
- [ ] Propose specific solutions/compromises where possible
- [ ] Explicitly reference CR 26(i) requirement in correspondence
- [ ] Allow reasonable time to review/respond; schedule call accordingly
- [ ] Prepare your checklist and relevant rules for the call
- [ ] During the call, discuss each issue and note any agreements/commitments
- [ ] After the call, send a written recap (email/letter) memorializing agreements and unresolved issues

---

## Step 8: Post-Conference Actions and Next Steps
<!-- anchor: step8-followup -->

### **Action Checklist**
- [ ] Monitor for compliance with promises (supplements, new documents, clarifications)
- [ ] Review new materials—confirm if deficiencies are cured
- [ ] If issues remain unresolved, prepare a motion to compel (attach certification of CR 26(i) conference)
- [ ] Keep a running log of all communication and outcomes
- [ ] Consider further discovery if new information arises (send additional RFPs, ROGs, etc.)
- [ ] Incorporate any admissions for use at trial; flag for CR 37(c) fee motions if appropriate
- [ ] Stay organized—update your master index and deficiency checklist as the case develops

## Conclusion

By following this structured, proactive approach—**verify, organize, audit, document, confer, and follow up**—you will maximize your chances of complete, timely, and compliant discovery in your Washington family law case.
